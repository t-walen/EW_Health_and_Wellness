          My name is Erin, and I am a holistic-certified Nurse Practitioner, currently working in integrative and alternative medicine. In the summer of 2022, my life quickly took a turn, as I was diagnosed with Hashimotoâ€™s Disease and then papillary carcinoma, shortly after. I have developed this site to share my story and ways I have integrated a healthier lifestyle. I believe in treating others and myself as a whole; physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. I hope by sharing my journey and knowledge in the medical field, I will be able to help support others going through a similar experience.
